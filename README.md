Demonstration driving the Raspberry Pi PiHut 3D Xmas tree using Python Asyncio

[The Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/) is selling a
[3D Xmas Tree](https://thepihut.com/products/3d-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi)
that plugs into the Raspberry Pi
[GPIO header](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/).

Raspbian includes a Python [GPIO Module](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/BasicUsage/) that facilitates working with PI I/O.

Recent versions of Python include [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/asyncio.html), which provides tools to allow multiple I/O-bound functions to work cooperatively in a single-threaded event loop.

This demo blinks each of the 25 lights on the tree at a constant, unique rate.

Note that this is not for the PiHut [3D RGB Tree](https://thepihut.com/products/3d-rgb-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi). I like the smaller (red) LEDs on this tree.

## How to Use It

The script requires the rpi.gpio package, which may not be installed by default


    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install rpi.gpio


Run '*./xmas.py*' to see the lights blink.

Change the constants in the script to change the blink parameters.

run '*sudo ./install.sh*' to have the blink program
come up automatically on boot.

The asyncio syntax used here requires Python 3.5 or newer. It will not run on stock Raspbian Jessie.

## How it Works, in Brief

In [xmas.py](https://github.com/davesteele/pihut-xmas-asyncio/blob/master/xmas.py), the *async* keyword turns a function into a *coroutine*, which is a cousin to a generator function.

Instead of *yield*-ing, the coroutine returns control to the calling function when it passes control to another coroutine, flagged with the *await* keyword.

The *ensure_future()* function submits coroutines to the main event loop, which is then called to kick things off.

The twinkling works by using Pulse Width Modulation ([PWM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation)) to randomly vary the brightness of the 'on' LEDs.

This version of xmas.py requires more CPU power than the original (~40% of one core on a Pi 3B, for the single-threaded code). The non-twinkling version, *xmas-orig.py*, uses less than 1%.
